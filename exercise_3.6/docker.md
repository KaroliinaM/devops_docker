Benefits of Docker

A Docker container is a kind of a capsule with a software and it’s dependencies running inside. It forms an entity which can communicate outside container in ways that are defined by the programmer. Docker can be used when building a resource that can be thought as a separate part of the whole program. Also, if the delivery is happening on a rapid page, the Docker is a good solution, because the software can be built and delivered in containers and the problems with deploying a software can be minimized.

The benefits of Docker are that the containers are lightweigh. They contain only the container images; they don’t need operating systems of their own, because they use the operating system of the host on which Docker is installed. A single host can run several Docker containers. 

Docker containers are also standard. The software can be built, shipped and run in a container and the development and deployment of software is easier when there’s no issues of possible divergence between development and production environment or the access control to the production environment. 

The docker containers are also secure, the software is running in an restricted environment withaout access to the outside system except for channels that are defined by developers of the priogram. Any malfunction of the software itself has very limited consequences.

Docker can be utilized, for example, when building a software that is using a database and the software and the database are running on different systems. Also the software might consist of several parts. With Docker, all the software parts can be developed and managed separately.

Docker might not be the best solution if the software has graphical interface. Docker is planned to run  on command line. There are workarounds, but Docker is not optimal for graphical solutions. Also, if the software is time-critical, it might be best to run in straight on the server operation system, without containers
